## FAILED USERS README
This script works similar to the logincheck script but instead of tracking IPs and countries. It tracks the usernames in failed login attempts.
Unlike the logincheck script, there isn't anything we have to install to get this script to work. All you need to know is the log file location of where login attempts are stored
<i> NOTE: This is the same log file location used in the logincheck script </i>
