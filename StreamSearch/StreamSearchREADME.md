####StreamSearch Script
This is a small script I made for fun to search for shows currently streaming on NetFlix or Hulu. This README will be a short explanation of each file in this folder.

** 1. StreamSearch.pl
  - This is the actual script. The purpose of this script is to see if a tv show is currently availible on Hulu-Plus or NetFlix. It reads in two txt files listed below. Running this script will prompt you to enter a tv show's full name and will then search from both text files to see if the show is currently availible on each streaming site.
  * * - ToDo: Add Movies for NetFlix and Hulu, Add HBOGo and Amazon.
  
** 2. hulu-shows
  - This is a text file containing every show currently streaming on Hulu-Plus as of 1/28/17. The script runs a filehandler to read from data in this script.

** 3. netflix-shows
  - This is a text file containing every show currently streaming on NetFlix as of 1/28/17. The script runs a filehandler to read from data in this script.
